    "We’ve put together a list of features we think would be essential to realise our vision for the Phantom Halls, which looks something like this:
    
    Multistorey mansion layout to explore with Metroidvania minimap.
    
    Retrace your steps with newfound items and abilities to unlock previously unaccessible areas.
    
    Scrolling levels, outdoor areas, platforming elements, and a variety of pitfalls and deadly drops to ensure varied gameplay that keeps throwing curveballs.
    
    Winding corridors and vast hallways that lead to a bizarre assortment of rooms each with themed sets of enemies and obstacles.
    
    Unique passive skills and abilities for 12 playable characters. (Control up to 4 characters at once)
    
    Combine up to 4 simultaneous or sequenced attacks for awesome combos.
    
    Dozens of enemy types and a myriad of mini-bosses to face.
    
    Infinite replay value with procedurally generated mansions.
    
    Unique final bosses generated for each mansion. The master/mistress of the house.
    
    Name generation for mansions, manors, halls, and masters and mistresses to ensure a record of your escapes, triumphs, and defeats. Achievements, etc.
    
    Customisable weapons, traps, potions, and other combinable items to enrich the looting experience and allow for personalisation of play style. 
    
    Survivors of each mansion can continue on to the next conquest with all the gear they’ve amassed. "
